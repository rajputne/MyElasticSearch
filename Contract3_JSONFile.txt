Making or Maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans. (a) Inability to Determine Applicable Interest   Rate. If, on or prior to any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any Interest Period for any Eurodollar   Rate Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and   binding on the parties hereto, absent manifest error) that by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank   market adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period,   then the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice (which may be telephonic) thereof to the Borrower and each   Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may be made as, or converted to, Eurodollar Rate Loans until   such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to   such notice no longer exist and (ii) any Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice given by the Borrower   with respect to the Loans in respect of which such determination was made shall be ineffective.

In the event that on any date any Lender shall have   determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that the making,   maintaining or continuation of its Eurodollar Rate Loans (i) has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such   Lender in good faith with any applicable law (or would conflict with any treaty, governmental rule, regulation,   guideline or order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful) or   (ii) has become impracticable as a result of contingencies occurring after the date hereof which materially and     adversely affect the London interbank market or the position of such Lender in that market, then, and in any such   event, such Lender shall be an \u201cAffected Lender\u201d and it shall on that day give notice (by facsimile or by telephone   confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the   Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). If the Administrative Agent receives (A) a   notice from any Lender pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence or (B) a notice from Lenders constituting the   Requisite Lenders pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, then (1) the obligation of such Lender (or, in the   case of a notice referred to in clause (B) above, the Lenders) to make Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar   Rate Loans shall be suspended until such notice shall have been withdrawn by such Lender (or, in the case of a   notice referred to in clause (B) above, Lenders constituting the Requisite Lenders), (2) to the extent any such notice   relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan or Loans then being requested by the Borrower pursuant to a Funding Notice or a   Conversion/Continuation Notice, such Lender (or, in the case of a notice referred to in clause (B) above, the   Lenders) shall make such Loan or Loans as (or continue such Loan or Loans as or convert such Loan or Loans to, as   the case may be) a Base Rate Loan or Loans, (3) such Lender\u2019s (or, in the case of a notice referred to in clause (B)   above, the Lenders\u2019) obligation to maintain outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans (the \u201cAffected Loans\u201d) shall be   terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected   Loans or when required by law and (4) the Affected Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans on the   date of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender or the   Requisite Lenders as described above relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by the Borrower   pursuant to a       35      Funding Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, the Borrower shall have the option, subject to the provisions   of Section 2.14(c), to rescind such Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice as to all Lenders by giving   written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent of such rescission   on the date on which the Affected Lender or the Requisite Lenders give notice of its or their determination as   described above (which notice of rescission the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to the Lenders).    (c) Compensation for Breakage. The Borrower shall compensate each Lender for all losses, costs, expenses   and liabilities that such Lender may sustain in the event (i) a borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur   on a date specified therefor in any Funding Notice given by the Borrower (other than as a result of a failure by such   Lender to make such Loan in accordance with its obligations hereunder), (ii) a conversion to or continuation of any   Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in any Conversion/Continuation Notice given by   the Borrower, (iii) any payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Rate Loan other than on the last day of an   Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or a Change in Control), (iv) the   conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, (v) the   assignment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto as a result   of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19 or (vi) a prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not   occur on a date specified therefor in any notice of prepayment given by the Borrower. Such loss, cost, expense or   liability to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of   (A) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not   occurred, at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan (but not including the   Applicable Margin applicable thereto), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current   Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have   been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (B) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount   for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period,   for Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London interbank market. To request   compensation under this paragraph, a Lender shall deliver to the Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable   detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this paragraph, which certificate   shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due   on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.    (d) Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Any Lender may make, carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at, to   or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of any Affiliate of such Lender.

Any of the terms defined herein may, unless the context otherwise requires, be   used in the singular or the plural, depending on the reference. References herein to any   ","Section 2.15":"Section 2.15 shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded     each of its relevant Eurodollar Rate Loans through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the rate   obtained pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of Adjusted       36      Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such Eurodollar Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable   to the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of such   Lender to a domestic office of such Lender in the United States of America; provided that each Lender may fund   each of its Eurodollar Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for   the purposes of calculating amounts payable under this Section 2.14 and under Section 2.15.

(e) Whenever any payment to be made hereunder with respect to any Loan shall be stated to be due on a day   that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any   payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.       33        (f) Any payment hereunder by or on behalf of the Borrower that is not received by the Administrative Agent   in same day funds prior to 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date due shall be deemed to have been received,   for purposes of computing interest and fees hereunder (including for purposes of determining applicability of   Section 2.07) on the Business Day next succeeding the date of receipt (or, if later, the Business Day next succeeding   the date the funds received become available funds).    (g) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and the maturity of the Loans shall have been accelerated   pursuant to  7, all payments or proceeds received by the Administrative Agent hereunder in respect of any of   the Obligations shall be applied, first, to the payment of all fees and other amounts owing to the Administrative   Agent (in its capacity as such), and, second, to the extent of any excess of such payment or proceeds, to the payment   of all other Obligations for the ratable benefit of the Guaranteed Parties entitled thereto.

Subject to   the provisions of Section 2.16 (which shall solely govern with respect to any Taxes imposed on or with respect to   any payment made by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Credit Document), in the event   that any Lender shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon   all parties hereto) that any Change in Law: (i) subjects such Lender (or its applicable lending office) to any   additional Tax (other than any Tax on the overall net income of such Lender) with respect to this Agreement or any   of the other Credit Documents or any of its Loans or obligations hereunder or thereunder or any deposits, reserves,   other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including any   marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or   similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or   loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender (other than any   such reserve or other requirements with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans that are reflected in the definition of   Adjusted Eurodollar Rate); or (iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or   affecting such Lender (or its applicable lending office) or its obligations or Loans hereunder or the London interbank   market; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make, making or   maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan hereunder or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender (or   its applicable lending office) with respect thereto; then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay to such   Lender, upon receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts (in the   form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole   discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or reduction   in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the   Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional   amounts owed to such Lender under this Section 2.15(a), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all   parties hereto absent manifest error. Such statement shall be in reasonable detail and shall certify that the claim for   additional amounts referred to therein is generally consistent with such Lender\u2019s treatment of similarly situated   customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in   circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or   proprietary information therein. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this   Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender\u2019s right to demand such compensation; provided that the   Borrower shall not be required       37      to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days   prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or   reductions and of such Lender\u2019s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in   Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall   be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.    (b) Capital Adequacy Adjustment. If any Lender determines that a Change in Law regarding capital or   liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or   any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to, such Lender\u2019s Loans or   Commitments or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans to a level below that which such Lender or   such controlling corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, phase in, applicability,   change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation with     regard to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time, within 10 Business Days after receipt by the   Borrower from such Lender of the statement referred to in the next sentence, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender   such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation for such   reduction. Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a written statement,   setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to Lender under this Section   2.16(b), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error. Such   statement shall be in reasonable detail and shall certify that the claim for additional amounts referred to therein is   generally consistent with such Lender\u2019s treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions   with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender   shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein. Failure or delay on the part of   any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender\u2019s right to   demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to   this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender   notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such reductions and of such Lender\u2019s intention to claim   compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions   is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect   thereof.    Section 2.16. Taxes; Withholding, Etc. (a) Payments to Be Free and Clear. All sums payable by or on account   of any obligation of any Credit Party hereunder or under the other Credit Documents, which sums are paid by any   Credit Party or the Administrative Agent shall (except to the extent required by law) be paid free and clear of, and   without any deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax.    (b) Withholding of Taxes. If any Credit Party or the Administrative Agent is required by law to make any   deduction or withholding on account of any Specified Tax from any sum paid or payable by any Credit Party to the   Administrative Agent or       38      any Lender under any of the Credit Documents: (i) the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any such   requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as the Borrower becomes aware of it; (ii) the applicable   Credit Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall pay any such Tax before the date on which   penalties attach thereto; (iii) the sum payable by such Credit Party in respect of which the relevant deduction or   withholding is required shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction   or withholding (including any deduction or withholding of Specified Taxes applicable to additional sums payable   under this Section 2.16), the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives on the due date a net   sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required or made; and   (iv) within 30 days after the due date of payment of any Tax which it is required to deduct or withhold, the Borrower   shall deliver to the Administrative Agent evidence reasonably satisfactory to the other affected parties of such   deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority; provided   that no such additional amount under clause (iii) above shall be required to be paid to any Lender (other than a   Lender that becomes a Lender pursuant to Section 2.19) except to the extent that any change after the date hereof (in   the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date), or after the effective date of the   Assignment Agreement pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), in any   such requirement for a deduction or withholding as is mentioned therein shall result in an increase in the rate of such   deduction or withholding from that in effect at the date hereof or at the date of such Assignment Agreement, as the   case may be, in respect of payments to such Lender; provided further that a Lender that shall have become a Lender   pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be entitled to receive only such additional amounts as such Lender\u2019s   assignor would have been entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16(b). For purposes of this Agreement,   FATCA shall be deemed to be in effect as of the date of this Agreement.    (c) Evidence of Exemption from U.S. Withholding Tax. Each Lender that is not a United States Person (as such   term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a \u201cNon-  US Lender\u201d) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower, on or prior to the Closing   Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date) or on or prior to the date   of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), and at such   other times as may be necessary in the determination of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (each in the     reasonable exercise of its discretion), (i) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI   and/or W-8IMY (or, in each case, any successor forms), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and   such other documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to   establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with   respect to any payments to such Lender of interest under any of the Credit Documents, or (ii) if such Lender is not a   \u201cbank\u201d or other Person described in Section 881(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, a Certificate re Non-Bank   Status together with two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form),   properly       39      completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under the Internal Revenue   Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or   withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of principal, interest,   fees or other amounts payable under any of the Credit Documents. Each Lender that is a United States person (as   such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for United States federal income tax   purposes (a \u201cU.S. Lender\u201d) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower on or prior to the Closing   Date (or, if later, on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement) two original   copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form), properly completed and duly executed by   such Lender, certifying that such U.S. Lender is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding   tax. Each Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to United States federal   income tax withholding matters pursuant to this Section 2.16(c) hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial   delivery by such Lender of such forms, certificates or other evidence, whenever a lapse in time or change in   circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that   such Lender shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower two new original   copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI and/or W-8IMY (or, in each case, any successor form),   or a Certificate re Non-Bank Status and two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any   successor form), as the case may be, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such other   documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to confirm or   establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with   respect to payments to such Lender under the Credit Documents, or notify the Administrative Agent and the   Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence. No Credit Party shall be required   to pay any additional amount pursuant to Section 2.16(b)(iii) or any indemnity payment pursuant to Section 2.16(d)   to any Lender if such Lender shall have failed (1) to deliver the forms, certificates or other evidence referred to in   the first two sentences of this Section 2.16(c) or (2) solely with respect to Non-US Lenders, to notify the   Administrative Agent and the Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence, as   the case may be; provided that if such Lender shall have satisfied the requirements of the first sentence of this   Section 2.16(c) on the Closing Date or on the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it became a   Lender, as applicable, nothing in this sentence of Section 2.16(c) shall relieve any Credit Party of its obligation to   pay any additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.16(b)(iii) or indemnity payments pursuant to Section 2.16(d) in the   event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any   change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to   deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject   to deduction or withholding as described herein. If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be   subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the   applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the   Internal Revenue Code, as applicable),       40      such Lender shall deliver to the Credit Parties or the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law   and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Credit Parties or the Administrative Agent, such   documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal   Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Credit Parties or the Administrative   Agent as may be necessary for the Credit Parties or the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under   FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender\u2019s obligations under FATCA and,     as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this   Section 2.16(c), \u201cFATCA\u201d shall include any statutory amendments made to FATCA after the date of this   Agreement.    (d) Indemnification. The applicable Credit Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender,   within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Specified Tax paid by the Administrative   Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of   such Credit Party hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (including any Specified Tax imposed or asserted   on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising   therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Specified Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by   the relevant taxing or other authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such   Credit Party by a Lender or the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive   absent manifest error.    (e) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its reasonable sole   discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Credit Party or with   respect to which any Credit Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.16(b)(iii), it shall pay over such   refund to the applicable Credit Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts   paid, by such Credit Party under Section 2.16(b)(iii) or 2.16(d), as applicable, with respect to the Taxes giving rise   to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender related to receipt of   the refund and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to   such refund); provided that such Credit Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees   to repay the amount paid over to such Credit Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the   relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent   or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 2.16(e) shall not be   construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other   information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Credit Party or any other Person.    Section 2.17. Obligation to Mitigate. Each Lender agrees that, as promptly as practicable after the officer of   such Lender responsible for administering its Loans becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the existence of   a condition that would cause such Lender to become an Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender to receive   payments under Section 2.15 or 2.16, it will, to the extent not       41      inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender and any applicable legal or regulatory restrictions, use   reasonable efforts to (a) make, issue, fund or maintain its Commitments or Loans, including any Affected Loans,   through another office of such Lender or (b) take such other measures as such Lender may deem reasonable   (including the provision to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of properly completed and executed   documentation or Tax forms), if as a result thereof the circumstances which would cause such Lender to be an   Affected Lender would cease to exist or the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to   such Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16 would be materially reduced and if, as determined by such Lender in   its sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of its Commitments or Loans through such other   office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise adversely affect such   Commitments, Loans or the interests of such Lender; provided that such Lender will not be obligated to utilize such   other office pursuant to this Section 2.17 unless the Borrower agrees to pay all incremental expenses incurred by   such Lender as a result of utilizing such other office as described above. A certificate as to the amount of any such   expenses payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.17 (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for   requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall   be conclusive absent manifest error.    Section 2.18. Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if one or   more Lenders become Defaulting Lenders, then, upon notice to such effect by the Administrative Agent (which   notice may be given only upon the Administrative Agent becoming aware that any Lender shall have become a   Defaulting Lender, including as a result of being advised thereof by the Borrower or the Requisite Lenders), the   following provisions shall apply for so long as any such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:      (a) the Commitment of each Defaulting Lender shall be disregarded in determining whether the Requisite   Lenders shall have taken any action hereunder or under any other Credit Document (including any consent to any   waiver, amendment or other modification pursuant to Section 9.05); provided that (x) the Commitment of any   Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver,   amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any   Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender;    (b) no commitment fee shall accrue on the unused amount of the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender   pursuant to Section 2.08; and    (c) any amount payable to or for the account of any Defaulting Lender in its capacity as a Lender hereunder   (whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise) may, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting   Lender, be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated account and be applied, at such time or times as   may be determined by the Administrative Agent, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender   to the Administrative Agent hereunder.       42      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to,   but may in its sole discretion, ascertain or inquire as to whether any Lender shall have become, or shall have ceased   to be, a Defaulting Lender, and shall not be required to give any notice or take any other action inconsistent with any   determination made by it as to whether any Lender is a Defaulting Lender.    Section 2.19. Removal or Replacement of a Lender. Anything contained herein to the contrary   notwithstanding, in the event that: (a) (i) any Lender (an \u201cIncreased-Cost Lender\u201d) shall give notice to the   Borrower that such Lender is an Affected Lender or that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under Section   2.15 or 2.16, (ii) the circumstances which have caused such Lender to be an Affected Lender or which entitle such   Lender to receive such payments shall remain in effect and (iii) such Lender shall fail to withdraw such notice   within five Business Days after the Borrower\u2019s request for such withdrawal; (b) any Lender shall become a   Defaulting Lender; or (c) in connection with any proposed waiver, amendment or other modification of any Credit   Document, or any consent to any departure by any Credit Party therefrom, of the type referred to in Section 9.05(b),   the consent of the Requisite Lenders shall have been obtained but the consent of one or more of such other Lenders   (each, a \u201cNon-Consenting Lender\u201d) whose consent is required but shall not have been obtained; then, with respect   to each such Increased-Cost Lender, Defaulting Lender or Non-Consenting Lender (each, a \u201cTerminated Lender\u201d),   the Borrower may, by giving written notice to the Administrative Agent and any Terminated Lender of its election   to do so, elect to cause such Terminated Lender (and such Terminated Lender hereby irrevocably agrees) to assign   its Commitment and its outstanding Loans, if any, in full to one or more Eligible Assignees (each, a \u201cReplacement   Lender\u201d) in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.06 and the Borrower shall pay the fees, if any, payable   under such Section in connection with any such assignment; provided that (i) on the date of such assignment, the   Replacement Lender shall pay to the Terminated Lender an amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal to the   principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of such Terminated Lender and (B) an amount equal   to all accrued, but theretofore unpaid commitment fees, if any, owing to such Terminated Lender pursuant to Section   2.08; (ii) on the date of such assignment, the Borrower shall pay any amounts payable to such Terminated Lender   pursuant to Section 2.14(c), 2.15 or 2.16; and (iii) in the event such Terminated Lender is a Non-Consenting Lender,   such Replacement Lender shall consent, at the time of such assignment, to each matter in respect of which such   Terminated Lender was a Non-Consenting Lender. If the Borrower exercises its option hereunder to cause an   assignment by any Terminated Lender, such Terminated Lender shall, promptly after receipt of written notice of   such election, execute and deliver all documentation necessary to effectuate such assignment in accordance with   Section 9.06. In the event that a Terminated Lender does not comply with the requirements of the immediately   preceding sentence within one Business Day after receipt of such notice, each Lender hereby authorizes and directs   the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver such documentation as may be required to give effect to an   assignment in accordance with Section 9.06 on behalf of such Terminated Lender and any such documentation so   executed by the       43      Administrative Agent shall be effective for purposes of documenting an assignment pursuant to Section 9.06.        ","Section 5.04":"Section 5.04. Maintenance of Properties. The Borrower will, and will cause each of the Subsidiaries to,   maintain or cause to be maintained in good repair, working order and condition in all material respects, ordinary   wear and tear and obsolescence excepted, all material tangible properties material to the conduct of the business of   the Borrower and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole, except where such failure to maintain or cause to be maintained   would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

The Borrower will, and will cause each of the Subsidiaries to, maintain with   financially sound and reputable insurance companies, insurance in such amounts and against such risks as is   customarily maintained by companies of established repute engaged in the same or similar businesses operating in   the same or similar locations.      ","Section 2.16":"Section 2.16 (which shall solely govern with respect to any Taxes imposed on or with respect to   any payment made by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Credit Document), in the event   that any Lender shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon   all parties hereto) that any Change in Law: (i) subjects such Lender (or its applicable lending office) to any   additional Tax (other than any Tax on the overall net income of such Lender) with respect to this Agreement or any   of the other Credit Documents or any of its Loans or obligations hereunder or thereunder or any deposits, reserves,   other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including any   marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or   similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or   loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender (other than any   such reserve or other requirements with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans that are reflected in the definition of   Adjusted Eurodollar Rate); or (iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or   affecting such Lender (or its applicable lending office) or its obligations or Loans hereunder or the London interbank   market; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make, making or   maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan hereunder or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender (or   its applicable lending office) with respect thereto; then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay to such   Lender, upon receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts (in the   form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole   discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or reduction   in amounts received or receivable hereunder.

If any Credit Party or the Administrative Agent is required by law to make any   deduction or withholding on account of any Specified Tax from any sum paid or payable by any Credit Party to the   Administrative Agent or       38      any Lender under any of the Credit Documents: (i) the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any such   requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as the Borrower becomes aware of it; (ii) the applicable   Credit Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall pay any such Tax before the date on which   penalties attach thereto; (iii) the sum payable by such Credit Party in respect of which the relevant deduction or   withholding is required shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction   or withholding (including any deduction or withholding of Specified Taxes applicable to additional sums payable   under this Section 2.16), the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives on the due date a net   sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required or made; and   (iv) within 30 days after the due date of payment of any Tax which it is required to deduct or withhold, the Borrower   shall deliver to the Administrative Agent evidence reasonably satisfactory to the other affected parties of such   deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority; provided   that no such additional amount under clause (iii) above shall be required to be paid to any Lender (other than a   Lender that becomes a Lender pursuant to Section 2.19) except to the extent that any change after the date hereof (in   the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date), or after the effective date of the   Assignment Agreement pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), in any   such requirement for a deduction or withholding as is mentioned therein shall result in an increase in the rate of such   deduction or withholding from that in effect at the date hereof or at the date of such Assignment Agreement, as the   case may be, in respect of payments to such Lender; provided further that a Lender that shall have become a Lender   pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be entitled to receive only such additional amounts as such Lender\u2019s   assignor would have been entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16(b). For purposes of this Agreement,   FATCA shall be deemed to be in effect as of the date of this Agreement.    (c) Evidence of Exemption from U.S. Withholding Tax. Each Lender that is not a United States Person (as such   term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a \u201cNon-  US Lender\u201d) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower, on or prior to the Closing   Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date) or on or prior to the date   of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), and at such   other times as may be necessary in the determination of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (each in the     reasonable exercise of its discretion), (i) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI   and/or W-8IMY (or, in each case, any successor forms), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and   such other documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to   establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with   respect to any payments to such Lender of interest under any of the Credit Documents, or (ii) if such Lender is not a   \u201cbank\u201d or other Person described in Section 881(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, a Certificate re Non-Bank   Status together with two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form),   properly       39      completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under the Internal Revenue   Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or   withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of principal, interest,   fees or other amounts payable under any of the Credit Documents. Each Lender that is a United States person (as   such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for United States federal income tax   purposes (a \u201cU.S. Lender\u201d) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower on or prior to the Closing   Date (or, if later, on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement) two original   copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form), properly completed and duly executed by   such Lender, certifying that such U.S. Lender is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding   tax. Each Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to United States federal   income tax withholding matters pursuant to this Section 2.16(c) hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial   delivery by such Lender of such forms, certificates or other evidence, whenever a lapse in time or change in   circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that   such Lender shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower two new original   copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI and/or W-8IMY (or, in each case, any successor form),   or a Certificate re Non-Bank Status and two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any   successor form), as the case may be, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such other   documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to confirm or   establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with   respect to payments to such Lender under the Credit Documents, or notify the Administrative Agent and the   Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence. No Credit Party shall be required   to pay any additional amount pursuant to Section 2.16(b)(iii) or any indemnity payment pursuant to Section 2.16(d)   to any Lender if such Lender shall have failed (1) to deliver the forms, certificates or other evidence referred to in   the first two sentences of this Section 2.16(c) or (2) solely with respect to Non-US Lenders, to notify the   Administrative Agent and the Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence, as   the case may be; provided that if such Lender shall have satisfied the requirements of the first sentence of this   Section 2.16(c) on the Closing Date or on the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it became a   Lender, as applicable, nothing in this sentence of Section 2.16(c) shall relieve any Credit Party of its obligation to   pay any additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.16(b)(iii) or indemnity payments pursuant to Section 2.16(d) in the   event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any   change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to   deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject   to deduction or withholding as described herein. If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be   subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the   applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the   Internal Revenue Code, as applicable),       40      such Lender shall deliver to the Credit Parties or the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law   and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Credit Parties or the Administrative Agent, such   documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal   Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Credit Parties or the Administrative   Agent as may be necessary for the Credit Parties or the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under   FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender\u2019s obligations under FATCA and,     as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this   Section 2.16(c), \u201cFATCA\u201d shall include any statutory amendments made to FATCA after the date of this   Agreement.    (d) Indemnification. The applicable Credit Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender,   within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Specified Tax paid by the Administrative   Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of   such Credit Party hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (including any Specified Tax imposed or asserted   on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising   therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Specified Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by   the relevant taxing or other authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such   Credit Party by a Lender or the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive   absent manifest error.    (e) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its reasonable sole   discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Credit Party or with   respect to which any Credit Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.16(b)(iii), it shall pay over such   refund to the applicable Credit Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts   paid, by such Credit Party under Section 2.16(b)(iii) or 2.16(d), as applicable, with respect to the Taxes giving rise   to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender related to receipt of   the refund and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to   such refund); provided that such Credit Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees   to repay the amount paid over to such Credit Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the   relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent   or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 2.16(e) shall not be   construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other   information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Credit Party or any other Person.

Without   limiting the foregoing, if any wholly-owned Material Domestic Subsidiary is formed or acquired after the Closing   Date (or if any Domestic Subsidiary becomes a wholly-owned Material Domestic Subsidiary after       52      the Closing Date), the Borrower will, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 30 days (or such longer   period as the Administrative Agent may agree to in writing), notify the Administrative Agent thereof and cause the   Guarantee Requirement to be satisfied with respect to such wholly-owned Material Domestic Subsidiary.

A certificate as to the amount of any such   expenses payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.17 (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for   requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall   be conclusive absent manifest error.
