hereof, each Lender agrees to make Loans to the Borrower in an aggregate principal amount that will not result in 

(i) such Lender’s Exposure exceeding such Lender’s Commitment or (ii) the aggregate Exposures exceeding the 

aggregate Commitments. Amounts repaid or prepaid in respect of the Loans may, subject to the terms and conditions 

hereof, be reborrowed during the Commitment Period.  

(b) Borrowing Mechanics. (i) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same 

Type made by the Lenders proportionately to their respective Pro Rata Shares. At the time each Borrowing is made, 

such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in 

excess of that amount; provided that a Base Rate Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the 

entire unused balance of the aggregate Commitments in effect at such time.  

(ii) To request a Borrowing, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a fully completed 

and executed Funding Notice (A) in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m. (New 

York City time) three Business Days before the proposed Credit Date or (B) in the case of a Base Rate 

Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the proposed Credit Date. In lieu of delivering 

a Funding Notice, the Borrower may give the Administrative Agent telephonic notice by the required time of 

any proposed Borrowing; provided that such telephonic notice shall be promptly confirmed in writing by 

delivery of a fully completed and executed Funding Notice to the Administrative Agent on or before the close 

of business on the date that such telephonic notice is given. In the event of any discrepancy between the 

telephonic notice and the written Funding Notice, the written Funding Notice shall govern. Promptly upon 

receipt by the Administrative Agent of a Funding Notice in accordance with this paragraph, the 

Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Loan 

to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.  



(iii) Each Lender shall make the principal amount of each Loan required to be made by it hereunder on 

any Credit Date available to the Administrative Agent not later than (i) 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on 

such Credit Date if the Funding Notice for the applicable Borrowing is delivered less than one Business Day 

prior to such Credit Date and (ii) 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such Credit Date if the Funding Notice 

for the applicable Borrowing is delivered at least one Business Day prior to the Credit Date, in each case by 

wire transfer of same day funds in Dollars to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently 

designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans 

available to the Borrower by promptly remitting the amounts so

received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower specified by the Borrower in the Funding Notice.  

 
 Key:Section 2.02
 Value:Section 2.02. Pro Rata Shares; Availability of Funds. (a) Pro Rata Shares. All Loans on the occasion of any 

Borrowing shall be made by the Lenders proportionately to their respective Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that 

(i) no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other Lender in such other Lender’s obligation to make a 

Loan requested hereunder and (ii) no Commitment of any Lender shall be increased or decreased as a result of a 

default by any other Lender in such other Lender’s obligation to make a Loan requested hereunder.  

(b) Availability of Funds. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender prior to the 

applicable Credit Date that such Lender does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent the amount 

of such Lender’s Loan requested on such Credit Date, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has 

made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such Credit Date and may, in its sole discretion, but 

shall not be obligated to, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount on such Credit Date. In such 

event, if a Lender has not in fact made the amount of such Lender’s Loan requested on such Credit Date available to 

the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative 

Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the 

date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative 

Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, (A) at any time prior to the third Business Day 

following the date such amount is made available to the Borrower, the customary rate set by the Administrative 

Agent for the correction of errors among banks and (B) thereafter, the Base Rate or (ii) in the case of a payment to 

be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable hereunder to Base Rate Loans. If such Lender pays such 

amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in the 

applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its 

Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower may have 

against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.  

 
 Key:Section 2.03
 Value:Section 2.03. Use of Proceeds. The Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loans for working capital and 

other general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to finance capital expenditures arising from the 

development of data center facilities of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, acquisitions and repurchases of Equity 

Interests and Indebtedness of the Borrower, and to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations arising upon the 

vesting and settlement of RSUs in connection with the Borrower’s IPO or to reimburse the Borrower for paying 

such tax withholding and remittance obligations. No portion of the proceeds of any Loan will be used in any manner 

that entails a violation of Regulation U or X of the Board of Governors.

records evidencing the Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Lender, including the principal amount of the 

Loans made  
  

27  

 
by such Lender and each repayment and prepayment in respect thereof. Such records maintained by any Lender 

shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower, absent manifest error; provided that the failure to maintain any 

such records, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to pay any amounts 

due hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided further that, in the event of any 

inconsistency between the records maintained by any Lender and the records maintained by the Administrative 

Agent, the records of the Administrative Agent shall govern.  



(b) Register. The Administrative Agent shall maintain at one of its offices records of the names and addresses 

of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time 

(the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and each Lender, 

absent manifest error. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender (with respect to 

any entry relating to such Lender’s Commitment or Loans) at any reasonable time and from time to time upon 

reasonable prior notice. The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative Agent to serve as the Borrower’s agent 

solely for purposes of maintaining the Register as provided in this Section 2.04 and agrees that, to the extent the 

Administrative Agent serves in such capacity, the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties shall constitute 

“Indemnitees”.  

(c) Notes. Upon request of any Lender that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note, the Borrower 

shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such 

Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns), which shall be in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. 

Each Lender agrees that delivery of any such promissory notes shall not be a condition precedent to the obligations 

of such Lender to make a Loan on any Credit Date.

principal amount thereof as follows:  

(i) in the case of a Base Rate Loan, at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin and  

(ii) in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Loan, at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin.  

The applicable Base Rate or Adjusted Eurodollar Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such 

determination shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto, absent manifest error.  

(b) The basis for determining the rate of interest with respect to any Loan, and the Interest Period with respect 

to any Eurodollar Rate Borrowing, shall be selected by the Borrower pursuant to the applicable Funding Notice or 

Conversion/Continuation Notice delivered in accordance herewith; provided that there shall be no more than 25 

Eurodollar Rate Borrowings outstanding at any time. In the event the Borrower fails to specify in the applicable 

Funding Notice the Type

of the requested Borrowing, then the requested Borrowing shall be made as a Base Rate Borrowing. In the event the 

Borrower fails to deliver in accordance with

 Value:Section 2.07, each Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding 

principal amount thereof as follows:

(ii) in the case of a Eurodollar Rate Loan, at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin.  

The applicable Base Rate or Adjusted Eurodollar Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such 

determination shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto, absent manifest error.  

(b) The basis for determining the rate of interest with respect to any Loan, and the Interest Period with respect 

to any Eurodollar Rate Borrowing, shall be selected by the Borrower pursuant to the applicable Funding Notice or 

Conversion/Continuation Notice delivered in accordance herewith; provided that there shall be no more than 25 

Eurodollar Rate Borrowings outstanding at any time. In the event the Borrower fails to specify in the applicable 

Funding Notice the Type  
  

28  

 
of the requested Borrowing, then the requested Borrowing shall be made as a Base Rate Borrowing. In the event the 

Borrower fails to deliver in accordance with Section 2.06 a Conversion/Continuation Notice with respect to any 

Eurodollar Rate Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is 

repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted into a Base Rate 

Borrowing. In the event the Borrower requests the making of, or the conversion to or continuation of, any Eurodollar 

Rate Borrowing but fails to specify in the applicable Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice the Interest 

Period to be applicable thereto, the Borrower shall be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.  

(c) Interest on Loans shall accrue on a daily basis and shall be computed (i) in the case of Base Rate Loans, on 

the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and (ii) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, on the basis 

of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues. In 

computing interest on any Loan, the date of the making of such Loan or the first day of an Interest Period applicable 

to such Loan or the most recent Interest Payment Date with respect to such Loan or, with respect to a Eurodollar 

Rate Loan being converted to a Base Rate Loan, the date of conversion of such Eurodollar Rate Loan to such Base 

Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be included, and the date of payment of such Loan or the expiration date of an 

Interest Period applicable to such Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a Eurodollar Rate 

Loan, the date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such Eurodollar Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be 

excluded; provided that if a Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one day’s interest shall accrue on 

such Loan.  

(d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable to such 

Loan and on the Commitment Termination Date; provided that (i) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of 

any Loan (other than a prepayment of a Base Rate Loan prior to the end of the Commitment Period), accrued 

interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and 



(ii) in the event of any conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, 

accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.  

Section 2.06. Conversion/Continuation. (a) Subject to Sections 2.05 and 2.14, the Borrower shall have the 

option:  

(i) to convert at any time all or any part of any Borrowing from one Type to the other Type; or  

(ii) to continue, at the end of the Interest Period applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Borrowing, all or any 

part of such Borrowing as a Eurodollar Rate Borrowing and to elect an Interest Period therefor;  

provided, in each case, that at the commencement of each Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Borrowing, 

such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than 

$5,000,000.  
  

29  

 
In the event any Borrowing shall have been converted or continued in accordance with this Section 2.06 in part, such 

conversion or continuation shall be allocated ratably, in accordance with the Pro Rata Shares, among the Lenders 

holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each part of such Borrowing resulting 

from such conversion or continuation shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  

(b) To exercise its option pursuant to this Section 2.06, the Borrower shall deliver a fully completed and 

executed Conversion/Continuation Notice to the Administrative Agent no later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City 

time) no later than (i) on the proposed conversion date, in the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Borrowing, or 

(ii) three Business Days in advance of the proposed conversion/continuation date, in the case of a conversion to, or a 

continuation of, a Eurodollar Rate Borrowing. In lieu of delivering a Conversion/Continuation Notice, the Borrower 

may give the Administrative Agent telephonic notice by the required time of any proposed conversion/continuation; 

provided that such telephonic notice shall be promptly confirmed in writing by delivery of a fully completed and 

executed Conversion/Continuation Notice to the Administrative Agent on or before the close of business on the date 

that such telephonic notice is given. In the event of any discrepancy between the telephonic notice and the written 

Conversion/Continuation Notice, the written Continuation/Conversion Notice shall govern. A 

Conversion/Continuation Notice for conversion to, or continuation of, any Eurodollar Rate Borrowing shall be 

irrevocable on and after the Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to the Interest Period requested, or 

deemed requested, for such Borrowing, and the Borrower shall be bound to effect a conversion or continuation in 

accordance therewith.  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if an Event of Default under clause (a), (e) or (f) of 

 7 or, at the request of the Requisite Lenders, any other Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is 

continuing, then no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Rate Borrowing.  

Section 2.07. Default Interest. If an Event of Default under clause (a), (e) or (f) of  7 or, at the request 

of the Requisite Lenders, any other Event of Default shall have occurred, then, from and after the date of the 

occurrence thereof and for so long as such Event of Default is continuing, the principal amount of all Loans 

outstanding and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all interest payments thereon and all fees and other 

amounts owing hereunder shall bear interest (including post petition interest in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy 

Code or other applicable bankruptcy laws), payable on demand, (a) in the case of the outstanding principal of any 

Loan, at a rate that is 1% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise applicable hereunder to such Loan and 

(b) in all other cases, at a rate (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed) 

that is 1% per annum in excess of the interest rate that would be applicable hereunder to a Base Rate Loan. Payment 

or acceptance of the increased rates of interest provided for in this Section 2.07 is not a permitted alternative to 

timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights 

or remedies of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable (a) quarterly 

in arrears during the Commitment Period, on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, commencing with

promptly confirmed by delivery of written notice) thereof to the Administrative Agent, at any time terminate in 

whole or from time to time permanently reduce in part, without premium or penalty, the Commitments; provided 

that (i) any such partial reduction of the Commitments shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less 

than $5,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if, after giving effect to any 

concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance herewith, the aggregate Exposures would exceed the aggregate 

Commitments. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the effective date (which shall be a Business 

Day) of such termination or reduction and the amount of any partial reduction; provided that a notice of termination 

or reduction of the Commitments may state that such notice is conditioned on the occurrence of one or more events 

specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent 

on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Promptly following receipt of any such 

notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the details thereof. Any partial reduction of the 

Commitments pursuant to this paragraph shall reduce the Commitments of the Lenders ratably, in accordance with 

the Pro Rata Shares.

Maturity Date then in effect. The Borrower may request the Lenders that do not elect to extend the Maturity Date to 

assign their Commitments in their entirety to one or more financial institutions pursuant to Section 9.06, which 

assignees will agree to extend the Maturity Date. If any Lender rejects, or is deemed to have rejected, the 

Borrower’s request to extend the Maturity Date, then (i) this Agreement shall terminate on the Maturity Date then in

thereof to be prepaid, and may be given by telephone or in writing (and, if given by telephone, shall promptly 

be confirmed in writing). Each such notice shall be irrevocable, and the principal amount of each Borrowing 

specified therein shall become due and payable on the prepayment date specified therein; provided that, if a 

notice of voluntary prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the 

Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice 

of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the 

Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the details thereof.  

(b) Change in Control Termination/Put Right. Promptly upon any Authorized Officer of the Borrower 

obtaining knowledge of the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative 

Agent and the Lenders a certificate of an Authorized Officer of the Borrower setting forth the details thereof and 

referring to the right of the Lenders under this Section 2.11(b) (the “Notice of Change in Control”). In the event the 

Notice of Change in Control shall have been delivered by the Borrower, each Lender shall have the right to require 

that (i) the Commitment, if any, of such Lender terminate in whole and (ii) the Borrower prepay all outstanding 

Loans of such Lender, which right may be exercised by written notice thereof delivered to the Borrower (with a 

copy to the Administrative Agent)  
  

32  

 
not later than the 45th day following the date on which the Notice of Change in Control shall have been delivered by 

the Borrower (it being understood that any Lender that shall have failed to exercise such right as set forth above 

shall be deemed to have waived such right). In the event that any Lender shall have exercised such right as set forth 

above, (i) the Borrower shall prepay, without premium or penalty but subject to Section 2.14(c), all the outstanding 

Loans of such Lender and (ii) the Commitment of such Lender shall automatically terminate in whole, in each case 

on the date that is the 60th day following the date on which the Notice of Change in Control shall have been 

delivered by the Borrower.  

 
 Key:Section 2.12
 Value:Section 2.12. General Provisions Regarding Payments. (a) All payments by the Borrower of principal, 

interest, fees and other Obligations shall be made in Dollars in same day funds, without defense, recoupment, setoff 

or counterclaim and free of any restriction or condition. All such payments shall be delivered not later than 3:00 

p.m. (New York City time) on the date due to such account as may be designated by the Administrative Agent for 

the account of the Persons entitled thereto; provided that payments made pursuant to Sections 9.02 and 9.03 shall be 

made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any payment received by it 

hereunder for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  

(b) All payments in respect of the principal amount of any Loan (other than a prepayment of a Base Rate Loan 

prior to the end of the Commitment Period) shall be accompanied by payment of accrued interest on the principal 

amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments (and, in any event, any payments in respect of any Loan on a 

date when interest is due and payable with respect to such Loan) shall be applied to the payment of interest then due 

and payable before application to principal.  

(c) Each repayment or prepayment of a Borrowing hereunder shall be allocated ratably, in accordance with 

their respective Pro Rata Shares, among the Lenders holding Loans included in the repaid or prepaid Borrowing, it 

being understood that this paragraph shall not apply to any prepayment made pursuant to Section 2.11(b).  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions hereof, if any Affected Lender makes Base Rate Loans in lieu of 

its Pro Rata Share of any Eurodollar Rate Loans, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise 

have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Rate Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted 

Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the Base Rate Loans made by such Lender in 

lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Rate Loans.  

(e) Whenever any payment to be made hereunder with respect to any Loan shall be stated to be due on a day 

that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any 

payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  
  

33  



 
(f) Any payment hereunder by or on behalf of the Borrower that is not received by the Administrative Agent 

in same day funds prior to 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date due shall be deemed to have been received, 

for purposes of computing interest and fees hereunder (including for purposes of determining applicability of 

Section 2.07) on the Business Day next succeeding the date of receipt (or, if later, the Business Day next succeeding 

the date the funds received become available funds).  

(g) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and the maturity of the Loans shall have been accelerated 

pursuant to  7, all payments or proceeds received by the Administrative Agent hereunder in respect of any of 

the Obligations shall be applied, first, to the payment of all fees and other amounts owing to the Administrative 

Agent (in its capacity as such), and, second, to the extent of any excess of such payment or proceeds, to the payment 

of all other Obligations for the ratable benefit of the Guaranteed Parties entitled thereto.  

 
 Key:Section 2.13 
 Key:Section 2.14
 Value:Section 2.14(c), prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part; 

provided that each partial voluntary prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral 

multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000.  

(ii) To make a voluntary prepayment pursuant to Section 2.11(a)(i), the Borrower shall notify the 

Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) (A) on the date of prepayment, in the 

case of prepayment of Base Rate Borrowings, or (B) at least three Business Days prior to the date of 

prepayment, in the case of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Borrowings. Each such notice shall specify the 



prepayment date (which shall be a Business Day) and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion 

thereof to be prepaid, and may be given by telephone or in writing (and, if given by telephone, shall promptly 

be confirmed in writing). Each such notice shall be irrevocable, and the principal amount of each Borrowing 

specified therein shall become due and payable on the prepayment date specified therein; provided that, if a 

notice of voluntary prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the 

Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.09, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice 

of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.09. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the 

Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the details thereof.  

(b) Change in Control Termination/Put Right. Promptly upon any Authorized Officer of the Borrower 

obtaining knowledge of the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative 

Agent and the Lenders a certificate of an Authorized Officer of the Borrower setting forth the details thereof and 

referring to the right of the Lenders under this Section 2.11(b) (the “Notice of Change in Control”). In the event the 

Notice of Change in Control shall have been delivered by the Borrower, each Lender shall have the right to require 

that (i) the Commitment, if any, of such Lender terminate in whole and (ii) the Borrower prepay all outstanding 

Loans of such Lender, which right may be exercised by written notice thereof delivered to the Borrower (with a 

copy to the Administrative Agent)  
  

32  

 
not later than the 45th day following the date on which the Notice of Change in Control shall have been delivered by 

the Borrower (it being understood that any Lender that shall have failed to exercise such right as set forth above 

shall be deemed to have waived such right). In the event that any Lender shall have exercised such right as set forth 

above, (i) the Borrower shall prepay, without premium or penalty but subject to Section 2.14(c), all the outstanding 

Loans of such Lender and (ii) the Commitment of such Lender shall automatically terminate in whole, in each case 

on the date that is the 60th day following the date on which the Notice of Change in Control shall have been 

delivered by the Borrower.  

Section 2.12. General Provisions Regarding Payments. (a) All payments by the Borrower of principal, 

interest, fees and other Obligations shall be made in Dollars in same day funds, without defense, recoupment, setoff 

or counterclaim and free of any restriction or condition. All such payments shall be delivered not later than 3:00 

p.m. (New York City time) on the date due to such account as may be designated by the Administrative Agent for 

the account of the Persons entitled thereto; provided that payments made pursuant to Sections 9.02 and 9.03 shall be 

made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any payment received by it 

hereunder for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  

(b) All payments in respect of the principal amount of any Loan (other than a prepayment of a Base Rate Loan 

prior to the end of the Commitment Period) shall be accompanied by payment of accrued interest on the principal 

amount being repaid or prepaid, and all such payments (and, in any event, any payments in respect of any Loan on a 

date when interest is due and payable with respect to such Loan) shall be applied to the payment of interest then due 

and payable before application to principal.  

(c) Each repayment or prepayment of a Borrowing hereunder shall be allocated ratably, in accordance with 

their respective Pro Rata Shares, among the Lenders holding Loans included in the repaid or prepaid Borrowing, it 

being understood that this paragraph shall not apply to any prepayment made pursuant to Section 2.11(b).  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions hereof, if any Affected Lender makes Base Rate Loans in lieu of 

its Pro Rata Share of any Eurodollar Rate Loans, all payments and prepayments of principal that would otherwise 

have been applied to repay the Eurodollar Rate Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the converted 

Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender shall instead be applied to repay the Base Rate Loans made by such Lender in 

lieu of, or resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Rate Loans.  

(e) Whenever any payment to be made hereunder with respect to any Loan shall be stated to be due on a day 

that is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any 

payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  
  

33  



 
(f) Any payment hereunder by or on behalf of the Borrower that is not received by the Administrative Agent 

in same day funds prior to 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date due shall be deemed to have been received, 

for purposes of computing interest and fees hereunder (including for purposes of determining applicability of 

Section 2.07) on the Business Day next succeeding the date of receipt (or, if later, the Business Day next succeeding 

the date the funds received become available funds).  

(g) If an Event of Default shall have occurred and the maturity of the Loans shall have been accelerated 

pursuant to  7, all payments or proceeds received by the Administrative Agent hereunder in respect of any of 

the Obligations shall be applied, first, to the payment of all fees and other amounts owing to the Administrative 

Agent (in its capacity as such), and, second, to the extent of any excess of such payment or proceeds, to the payment 

of all other Obligations for the ratable benefit of the Guaranteed Parties entitled thereto.  

Section 2.13. Ratable Sharing. If any Lender shall, whether by voluntary payment, through the exercise of any 

right of set-off or banker’s lien, by counterclaim or cross action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit 

Documents or otherwise or as adequate protection of a deposit treated as cash collateral under the Bankruptcy Code, 

receive payment in respect of any principal, interest or commitment fees then due and owing to such Lender 

hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (collectively, the “Aggregate Amounts Due” to such Lender) 

resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such Lender 

than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the Aggregate Amounts Due to such other Lender, 

then the Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent and each 

other Lender of the receipt of such payment and (b) apply a portion of such payment to purchase (for cash at face 

value) participations in the Aggregate Amounts Due to the other Lenders so that all such payments of Aggregate 

Amounts Due shall be shared by all the Lenders ratably in accordance with the Aggregate Amounts Due to them; 

provided that, if all or part of such proportionately greater payment received by such purchasing Lender is thereafter 

recovered from such Lender upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or otherwise, those purchases 

shall be rescinded and the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be returned to such purchasing Lender 

ratably to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing 

arrangement and agrees that any holder of a participation so purchased may exercise any and all rights of banker’s 

lien, consolidation, set-off or counterclaim with respect to any and all monies owing by the Borrower to such holder 

with respect thereto as fully as if such holder were owed the amount of the participation held by such holder. The 

provisions of this Section 2.13 shall not be construed to apply to (i) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to 

and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including any payment made by the Borrower to any 

Lender as a result of such Lender exercising its right under Section 2.11(b)) or (ii) any payment obtained by any 

Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or other Obligations 

owing to it.

Section 2.14. Making or Maintaining Eurodollar Rate Loans. (a) Inability to Determine Applicable Interest 

Rate. If, on or prior to any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any Interest Period for any Eurodollar 

Rate Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and 

binding on the parties hereto, absent manifest error) that by reason of circumstances affecting the London interbank 

market adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, 

then the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice (which may be telephonic) thereof to the Borrower and each 

Lender of such determination, whereupon (i) no Loans may be made as, or converted to, Eurodollar Rate Loans until 

such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to 

such notice no longer exist and (ii) any Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice given by the Borrower 

with respect to the Loans in respect of which such determination was made shall be ineffective.  

(b) Illegality or Impracticability of Eurodollar Rate Loans. In the event that on any date any Lender shall have 

determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that the making, 

maintaining or continuation of its Eurodollar Rate Loans (i) has become unlawful as a result of compliance by such 

Lender in good faith with any applicable law (or would conflict with any treaty, governmental rule, regulation, 

guideline or order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful) or 

(ii) has become impracticable as a result of contingencies occurring after the date hereof which materially and 



adversely affect the London interbank market or the position of such Lender in that market, then, and in any such 

event, such Lender shall be an “Affected Lender” and it shall on that day give notice (by facsimile or by telephone 

confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the 

Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each other Lender). If the Administrative Agent receives (A) a 

notice from any Lender pursuant to clause (i) of the preceding sentence or (B) a notice from Lenders constituting the 

Requisite Lenders pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, then (1) the obligation of such Lender (or, in the 

case of a notice referred to in clause (B) above, the Lenders) to make Loans as, or to convert Loans to, Eurodollar 

Rate Loans shall be suspended until such notice shall have been withdrawn by such Lender (or, in the case of a 

notice referred to in clause (B) above, Lenders constituting the Requisite Lenders), (2) to the extent any such notice 

relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan or Loans then being requested by the Borrower pursuant to a Funding Notice or a 

Conversion/Continuation Notice, such Lender (or, in the case of a notice referred to in clause (B) above, the 

Lenders) shall make such Loan or Loans as (or continue such Loan or Loans as or convert such Loan or Loans to, as 

the case may be) a Base Rate Loan or Loans, (3) such Lender’s (or, in the case of a notice referred to in clause (B) 

above, the Lenders’) obligation to maintain outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans (the “Affected Loans”) shall be 

terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected 

Loans or when required by law and (4) the Affected Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans on the 

date of such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a determination by an Affected Lender or the 

Requisite Lenders as described above relates to a Eurodollar Rate Loan then being requested by the Borrower 

pursuant to a  
  

35  

 
Funding Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, the Borrower shall have the option, subject to the provisions 

of Section 2.14(c), to rescind such Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice as to all Lenders by giving 

written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Administrative Agent of such rescission 

on the date on which the Affected Lender or the Requisite Lenders give notice of its or their determination as 

described above (which notice of rescission the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to the Lenders).  

(c) Compensation for Breakage. The Borrower shall compensate each Lender for all losses, costs, expenses 

and liabilities that such Lender may sustain in the event (i) a borrowing of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur 

on a date specified therefor in any Funding Notice given by the Borrower (other than as a result of a failure by such 

Lender to make such Loan in accordance with its obligations hereunder), (ii) a conversion to or continuation of any 

Eurodollar Rate Loan does not occur on a date specified therefor in any Conversion/Continuation Notice given by 

the Borrower, (iii) any payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Rate Loan other than on the last day of an 

Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or a Change in Control), (iv) the 

conversion of any Eurodollar Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, (v) the 

assignment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto as a result 

of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19 or (vi) a prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not 

occur on a date specified therefor in any notice of prepayment given by the Borrower. Such loss, cost, expense or 

liability to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of 

(A) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not 

occurred, at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan (but not including the 

Applicable Margin applicable thereto), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current 

Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have 

been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (B) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount 

for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, 

for Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London interbank market. To request 

compensation under this paragraph, a Lender shall deliver to the Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable 

detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this paragraph, which certificate 

shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due 

on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  

(d) Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Any Lender may make, carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at, to 

or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of any Affiliate of such Lender.  

(e) Assumptions Concerning Funding of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Calculation of all amounts payable to a 

Lender under this Section 2.14 and under  
 Key:Section 2.15
 Value:Section 2.15 shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded 



each of its relevant Eurodollar Rate Loans through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the rate 

obtained pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of Adjusted  
  

36  

 
Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such Eurodollar Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable 

to the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of such 

Lender to a domestic office of such Lender in the United States of America; provided that each Lender may fund 

each of its Eurodollar Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for 

the purposes of calculating amounts payable under this Section 2.14 and under Section 2.15.  

Section 2.15. Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy. (a) Compensation for Increased Costs and Taxes. Subject to 

the provisions of  
 Key:Section 2.16
 Value:Section 2.16 (which shall solely govern with respect to any Taxes imposed on or with respect to 

any payment made by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Credit Document), in the event 

that any Lender shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon 

all parties hereto) that any Change in Law: (i) subjects such Lender (or its applicable lending office) to any 

additional Tax (other than any Tax on the overall net income of such Lender) with respect to this Agreement or any 

of the other Credit Documents or any of its Loans or obligations hereunder or thereunder or any deposits, reserves, 

other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including any 

marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or 

similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or 

loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender (other than any 

such reserve or other requirements with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans that are reflected in the definition of 

Adjusted Eurodollar Rate); or (iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or 

affecting such Lender (or its applicable lending office) or its obligations or Loans hereunder or the London interbank 

market; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make, making or 

maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan hereunder or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender (or 

its applicable lending office) with respect thereto; then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay to such 

Lender, upon receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts (in the 

form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole 

discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or reduction 

in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the 

Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional 

amounts owed to such Lender under this Section 2.15(a), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all 

parties hereto absent manifest error. Such statement shall be in reasonable detail and shall certify that the claim for 

additional amounts referred to therein is generally consistent with such Lender’s treatment of similarly situated 

customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in 

circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or 

proprietary information therein. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this 

Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the 

Borrower shall not be required  
  

37  

 
to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days 

prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or 

reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in 

Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall 

be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  

(b) Capital Adequacy Adjustment. If any Lender determines that a Change in Law regarding capital or 

liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or 

any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to, such Lender’s Loans or 

Commitments or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans to a level below that which such Lender or 

such controlling corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, phase in, applicability, 

change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation with 



regard to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time, within 10 Business Days after receipt by the 

Borrower from such Lender of the statement referred to in the next sentence, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender 

such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation for such 

reduction. Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a written statement, 

setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to Lender under this Section 

2.16(b), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error. Such 

statement shall be in reasonable detail and shall certify that the claim for additional amounts referred to therein is 

generally consistent with such Lender’s treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions 

with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender 

shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein. Failure or delay on the part of 

any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to 

demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to 

this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender 

notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim 

compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions 

is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect 

thereof.  

Section 2.16. Taxes; Withholding, Etc. (a) Payments to Be Free and Clear. All sums payable by or on account 

of any obligation of any Credit Party hereunder or under the other Credit Documents, which sums are paid by any 

Credit Party or the Administrative Agent shall (except to the extent required by law) be paid free and clear of, and 

without any deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax.  

(b) Withholding of Taxes. If any Credit Party or the Administrative Agent is required by law to make any 

deduction or withholding on account of any Specified Tax from any sum paid or payable by any Credit Party to the 

Administrative Agent or  
  

38  

 
any Lender under any of the Credit Documents: (i) the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any such 

requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as the Borrower becomes aware of it; (ii) the applicable 

Credit Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall pay any such Tax before the date on which 

penalties attach thereto; (iii) the sum payable by such Credit Party in respect of which the relevant deduction or 

withholding is required shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction 

or withholding (including any deduction or withholding of Specified Taxes applicable to additional sums payable 

under this Section 2.16), the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives on the due date a net 

sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required or made; and 

(iv) within 30 days after the due date of payment of any Tax which it is required to deduct or withhold, the Borrower 

shall deliver to the Administrative Agent evidence reasonably satisfactory to the other affected parties of such 

deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority; provided 

that no such additional amount under clause (iii) above shall be required to be paid to any Lender (other than a 

Lender that becomes a Lender pursuant to Section 2.19) except to the extent that any change after the date hereof (in 

the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date), or after the effective date of the 

Assignment Agreement pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), in any 

such requirement for a deduction or withholding as is mentioned therein shall result in an increase in the rate of such 

deduction or withholding from that in effect at the date hereof or at the date of such Assignment Agreement, as the 

case may be, in respect of payments to such Lender; provided further that a Lender that shall have become a Lender 

pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be entitled to receive only such additional amounts as such Lender’s 

assignor would have been entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16(b). For purposes of this Agreement, 

FATCA shall be deemed to be in effect as of the date of this Agreement.  

(c) Evidence of Exemption from U.S. Withholding Tax. Each Lender that is not a United States Person (as such 

term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “Non-

US Lender”) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower, on or prior to the Closing 

Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date) or on or prior to the date 

of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), and at such 

other times as may be necessary in the determination of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (each in the 



reasonable exercise of its discretion), (i) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI 

and/or W-8IMY (or, in each case, any successor forms), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and 

such other documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to 

establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with 

respect to any payments to such Lender of interest under any of the Credit Documents, or (ii) if such Lender is not a 

“bank” or other Person described in Section 881(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, a Certificate re Non-Bank 

Status together with two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form), 

properly  
  

39  

 
completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under the Internal Revenue 

Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or 

withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of principal, interest, 

fees or other amounts payable under any of the Credit Documents. Each Lender that is a United States person (as 

such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for United States federal income tax 

purposes (a “U.S. Lender”) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower on or prior to the Closing 

Date (or, if later, on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement) two original 

copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form), properly completed and duly executed by 

such Lender, certifying that such U.S. Lender is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding 

tax. Each Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to United States federal 

income tax withholding matters pursuant to this Section 2.16(c) hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial 

delivery by such Lender of such forms, certificates or other evidence, whenever a lapse in time or change in 

circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that 

such Lender shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower two new original 

copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI and/or W-8IMY (or, in each case, any successor form), 

or a Certificate re Non-Bank Status and two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any 

successor form), as the case may be, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such other 

documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to confirm or 

establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with 

respect to payments to such Lender under the Credit Documents, or notify the Administrative Agent and the 

Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence. No Credit Party shall be required 

to pay any additional amount pursuant to Section 2.16(b)(iii) or any indemnity payment pursuant to Section 2.16(d) 

to any Lender if such Lender shall have failed (1) to deliver the forms, certificates or other evidence referred to in 

the first two sentences of this Section 2.16(c) or (2) solely with respect to Non-US Lenders, to notify the 

Administrative Agent and the Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence, as 

the case may be; provided that if such Lender shall have satisfied the requirements of the first sentence of this 

Section 2.16(c) on the Closing Date or on the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it became a 

Lender, as applicable, nothing in this sentence of Section 2.16(c) shall relieve any Credit Party of its obligation to 

pay any additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.16(b)(iii) or indemnity payments pursuant to Section 2.16(d) in the 

event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any 

change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to 

deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject 

to deduction or withholding as described herein. If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be 

subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the 

applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the 

Internal Revenue Code, as applicable),  
  

40  

 
such Lender shall deliver to the Credit Parties or the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law 

and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Credit Parties or the Administrative Agent, such 

documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal 

Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Credit Parties or the Administrative 

Agent as may be necessary for the Credit Parties or the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under 

FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA and, 



as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this 

Section 2.16(c), “FATCA” shall include any statutory amendments made to FATCA after the date of this 

Agreement.  

(d) Indemnification. The applicable Credit Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, 

within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Specified Tax paid by the Administrative 

Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of 

such Credit Party hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (including any Specified Tax imposed or asserted 

on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising 

therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Specified Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by 

the relevant taxing or other authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such 

Credit Party by a Lender or the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive 

absent manifest error.  

(e) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its reasonable sole 

discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Credit Party or with 

respect to which any Credit Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.16(b)(iii), it shall pay over such 

refund to the applicable Credit Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts 

paid, by such Credit Party under Section 2.16(b)(iii) or 2.16(d), as applicable, with respect to the Taxes giving rise 

to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender related to receipt of 

the refund and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to 

such refund); provided that such Credit Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees 

to repay the amount paid over to such Credit Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the 

relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent 

or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 2.16(e) shall not be 

construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other 

information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Credit Party or any other Person.  

 
 Key:Section 2.17
 Value:Section 2.17. Obligation to Mitigate. Each Lender agrees that, as promptly as practicable after the officer of 

such Lender responsible for administering its Loans becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the existence of 

a condition that would cause such Lender to become an Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender to receive 

payments under Section 2.15 or 2.16, it will, to the extent not  
  

41  

 
inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender and any applicable legal or regulatory restrictions, use 

reasonable efforts to (a) make, issue, fund or maintain its Commitments or Loans, including any Affected Loans, 

through another office of such Lender or (b) take such other measures as such Lender may deem reasonable 

(including the provision to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of properly completed and executed 

documentation or Tax forms), if as a result thereof the circumstances which would cause such Lender to be an 

Affected Lender would cease to exist or the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to 

such Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16 would be materially reduced and if, as determined by such Lender in 

its sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of its Commitments or Loans through such other 

office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise adversely affect such 

Commitments, Loans or the interests of such Lender; provided that such Lender will not be obligated to utilize such 

other office pursuant to this Section 2.17 unless the Borrower agrees to pay all incremental expenses incurred by 

such Lender as a result of utilizing such other office as described above. A certificate as to the amount of any such 

expenses payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.17 (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for 

requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall 

be conclusive absent manifest error.  

 
 Key:Section 2.18 
 Key:Section 2.18 
 Value:Section 2.19 or (vi) a prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loan does not 

occur on a date specified therefor in any notice of prepayment given by the Borrower. Such loss, cost, expense or 

liability to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of 

(A) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not 

occurred, at the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan (but not including the 

Applicable Margin applicable thereto), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current 

Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have 

been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (B) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount 

for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, 

for Dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London interbank market. To request 

compensation under this paragraph, a Lender shall deliver to the Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable 

detail any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this paragraph, which certificate 

shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due 

on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.  

(d) Booking of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Any Lender may make, carry or transfer Eurodollar Rate Loans at, to 

or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of any Affiliate of such Lender.  

(e) Assumptions Concerning Funding of Eurodollar Rate Loans. Calculation of all amounts payable to a 

Lender under this Section 2.14 and under Section 2.15 shall be made as though such Lender had actually funded 



each of its relevant Eurodollar Rate Loans through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the rate 

obtained pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of Adjusted  
  

36  

 
Eurodollar Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such Eurodollar Rate Loan and having a maturity comparable 

to the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such Eurodollar deposit from an offshore office of such 

Lender to a domestic office of such Lender in the United States of America; provided that each Lender may fund 

each of its Eurodollar Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for 

the purposes of calculating amounts payable under this Section 2.14 and under Section 2.15.  

Section 2.15. Increased Costs; Capital Adequacy. (a) Compensation for Increased Costs and Taxes. Subject to 

the provisions of Section 2.16 (which shall solely govern with respect to any Taxes imposed on or with respect to 

any payment made by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party under any Credit Document), in the event 

that any Lender shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon 

all parties hereto) that any Change in Law: (i) subjects such Lender (or its applicable lending office) to any 

additional Tax (other than any Tax on the overall net income of such Lender) with respect to this Agreement or any 

of the other Credit Documents or any of its Loans or obligations hereunder or thereunder or any deposits, reserves, 

other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including any 

marginal, emergency, supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance or 

similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or 

loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender (other than any 

such reserve or other requirements with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans that are reflected in the definition of 

Adjusted Eurodollar Rate); or (iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on or 

affecting such Lender (or its applicable lending office) or its obligations or Loans hereunder or the London interbank 

market; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make, making or 

maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan hereunder or to reduce any amount received or receivable by such Lender (or 

its applicable lending office) with respect thereto; then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay to such 

Lender, upon receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such additional amount or amounts (in the 

form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole 

discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender for any such increased cost or reduction 

in amounts received or receivable hereunder. Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the 

Administrative Agent) a written statement, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional 

amounts owed to such Lender under this Section 2.15(a), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all 

parties hereto absent manifest error. Such statement shall be in reasonable detail and shall certify that the claim for 

additional amounts referred to therein is generally consistent with such Lender’s treatment of similarly situated 

customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in 

circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or 

proprietary information therein. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this 

Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the 

Borrower shall not be required  
  

37  

 
to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days 

prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or 

reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in 

Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall 

be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.  

(b) Capital Adequacy Adjustment. If any Lender determines that a Change in Law regarding capital or 

liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Lender or 

any corporation controlling such Lender as a consequence of, or with reference to, such Lender’s Loans or 

Commitments or other obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans to a level below that which such Lender or 

such controlling corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, phase in, applicability, 

change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Lender or such controlling corporation with 



regard to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time, within 10 Business Days after receipt by the 

Borrower from such Lender of the statement referred to in the next sentence, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender 

such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such controlling corporation for such 

reduction. Such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a written statement, 

setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional amounts owed to Lender under this Section 

2.16(b), which statement shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error. Such 

statement shall be in reasonable detail and shall certify that the claim for additional amounts referred to therein is 

generally consistent with such Lender’s treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions 

with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender 

shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein. Failure or delay on the part of 

any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to 

demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to 

this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender 

notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim 

compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions 

is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect 

thereof.  

Section 2.16. Taxes; Withholding, Etc. (a) Payments to Be Free and Clear. All sums payable by or on account 

of any obligation of any Credit Party hereunder or under the other Credit Documents, which sums are paid by any 

Credit Party or the Administrative Agent shall (except to the extent required by law) be paid free and clear of, and 

without any deduction or withholding on account of, any Tax.  

(b) Withholding of Taxes. If any Credit Party or the Administrative Agent is required by law to make any 

deduction or withholding on account of any Specified Tax from any sum paid or payable by any Credit Party to the 

Administrative Agent or  
  

38  

 
any Lender under any of the Credit Documents: (i) the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any such 

requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as the Borrower becomes aware of it; (ii) the applicable 

Credit Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall pay any such Tax before the date on which 

penalties attach thereto; (iii) the sum payable by such Credit Party in respect of which the relevant deduction or 

withholding is required shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction 

or withholding (including any deduction or withholding of Specified Taxes applicable to additional sums payable 

under this Section 2.16), the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, receives on the due date a net 

sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required or made; and 

(iv) within 30 days after the due date of payment of any Tax which it is required to deduct or withhold, the Borrower 

shall deliver to the Administrative Agent evidence reasonably satisfactory to the other affected parties of such 

deduction, withholding or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other authority; provided 

that no such additional amount under clause (iii) above shall be required to be paid to any Lender (other than a 

Lender that becomes a Lender pursuant to Section 2.19) except to the extent that any change after the date hereof (in 

the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date), or after the effective date of the 

Assignment Agreement pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), in any 

such requirement for a deduction or withholding as is mentioned therein shall result in an increase in the rate of such 

deduction or withholding from that in effect at the date hereof or at the date of such Assignment Agreement, as the 

case may be, in respect of payments to such Lender; provided further that a Lender that shall have become a Lender 

pursuant to an Assignment Agreement shall be entitled to receive only such additional amounts as such Lender’s 

assignor would have been entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.16(b). For purposes of this Agreement, 

FATCA shall be deemed to be in effect as of the date of this Agreement.  

(c) Evidence of Exemption from U.S. Withholding Tax. Each Lender that is not a United States Person (as such 

term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “Non-

US Lender”) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower, on or prior to the Closing 

Date (in the case of each Lender listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date) or on or prior to the date 

of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the case of each other Lender), and at such 

other times as may be necessary in the determination of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (each in the 



reasonable exercise of its discretion), (i) two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI 

and/or W-8IMY (or, in each case, any successor forms), properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and 

such other documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to 

establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with 

respect to any payments to such Lender of interest under any of the Credit Documents, or (ii) if such Lender is not a 

“bank” or other Person described in Section 881(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, a Certificate re Non-Bank 

Status together with two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any successor form), 

properly  
  

39  

 
completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under the Internal Revenue 

Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or 

withholding of United States federal income tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of principal, interest, 

fees or other amounts payable under any of the Credit Documents. Each Lender that is a United States person (as 

such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code) for United States federal income tax 

purposes (a “U.S. Lender”) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower on or prior to the Closing 

Date (or, if later, on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement) two original 

copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form), properly completed and duly executed by 

such Lender, certifying that such U.S. Lender is entitled to an exemption from United States backup withholding 

tax. Each Lender required to deliver any forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to United States federal 

income tax withholding matters pursuant to this Section 2.16(c) hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial 

delivery by such Lender of such forms, certificates or other evidence, whenever a lapse in time or change in 

circumstances renders such forms, certificates or other evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that 

such Lender shall promptly deliver to the Administrative Agent for transmission to the Borrower two new original 

copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8ECI and/or W-8IMY (or, in each case, any successor form), 

or a Certificate re Non-Bank Status and two original copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or any 

successor form), as the case may be, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and such other 

documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrower to confirm or 

establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax with 

respect to payments to such Lender under the Credit Documents, or notify the Administrative Agent and the 

Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence. No Credit Party shall be required 

to pay any additional amount pursuant to Section 2.16(b)(iii) or any indemnity payment pursuant to Section 2.16(d) 

to any Lender if such Lender shall have failed (1) to deliver the forms, certificates or other evidence referred to in 

the first two sentences of this Section 2.16(c) or (2) solely with respect to Non-US Lenders, to notify the 

Administrative Agent and the Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence, as 

the case may be; provided that if such Lender shall have satisfied the requirements of the first sentence of this 

Section 2.16(c) on the Closing Date or on the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it became a 

Lender, as applicable, nothing in this sentence of Section 2.16(c) shall relieve any Credit Party of its obligation to 

pay any additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.16(b)(iii) or indemnity payments pursuant to Section 2.16(d) in the 

event that, as a result of any change in any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any 

change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly entitled to 

deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject 

to deduction or withholding as described herein. If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would be 

subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the 

applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the 

Internal Revenue Code, as applicable),  
  

40  

 
such Lender shall deliver to the Credit Parties or the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law 

and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Credit Parties or the Administrative Agent, such 

documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal 

Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Credit Parties or the Administrative 

Agent as may be necessary for the Credit Parties or the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under 

FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA and, 



as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this 

Section 2.16(c), “FATCA” shall include any statutory amendments made to FATCA after the date of this 

Agreement.  

(d) Indemnification. The applicable Credit Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, 

within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Specified Tax paid by the Administrative 

Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of 

such Credit Party hereunder or under the other Credit Documents (including any Specified Tax imposed or asserted 

on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising 

therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Specified Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by 

the relevant taxing or other authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to such 

Credit Party by a Lender or the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender shall be conclusive 

absent manifest error.  

(e) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its reasonable sole 

discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Credit Party or with 

respect to which any Credit Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to Section 2.16(b)(iii), it shall pay over such 

refund to the applicable Credit Party (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts 

paid, by such Credit Party under Section 2.16(b)(iii) or 2.16(d), as applicable, with respect to the Taxes giving rise 

to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender related to receipt of 

the refund and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to 

such refund); provided that such Credit Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees 

to repay the amount paid over to such Credit Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the 

relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent 

or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section 2.16(e) shall not be 

construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other 

information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Credit Party or any other Person.  

Section 2.17. Obligation to Mitigate. Each Lender agrees that, as promptly as practicable after the officer of 

such Lender responsible for administering its Loans becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the existence of 

a condition that would cause such Lender to become an Affected Lender or that would entitle such Lender to receive 

payments under Section 2.15 or 2.16, it will, to the extent not  
  

41  

 
inconsistent with the internal policies of such Lender and any applicable legal or regulatory restrictions, use 

reasonable efforts to (a) make, issue, fund or maintain its Commitments or Loans, including any Affected Loans, 

through another office of such Lender or (b) take such other measures as such Lender may deem reasonable 

(including the provision to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of properly completed and executed 

documentation or Tax forms), if as a result thereof the circumstances which would cause such Lender to be an 

Affected Lender would cease to exist or the additional amounts which would otherwise be required to be paid to 

such Lender pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.16 would be materially reduced and if, as determined by such Lender in 

its sole discretion, the making, issuing, funding or maintaining of its Commitments or Loans through such other 

office or in accordance with such other measures, as the case may be, would not otherwise adversely affect such 

Commitments, Loans or the interests of such Lender; provided that such Lender will not be obligated to utilize such 

other office pursuant to this Section 2.17 unless the Borrower agrees to pay all incremental expenses incurred by 

such Lender as a result of utilizing such other office as described above. A certificate as to the amount of any such 

expenses payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.17 (setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for 

requesting such amount) submitted by such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall 

be conclusive absent manifest error.  

Section 2.18. Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if one or 

more Lenders become Defaulting Lenders, then, upon notice to such effect by the Administrative Agent (which 

notice may be given only upon the Administrative Agent becoming aware that any Lender shall have become a 

Defaulting Lender, including as a result of being advised thereof by the Borrower or the Requisite Lenders), the 

following provisions shall apply for so long as any such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:  



(a) the Commitment of each Defaulting Lender shall be disregarded in determining whether the Requisite 

Lenders shall have taken any action hereunder or under any other Credit Document (including any consent to any 

waiver, amendment or other modification pursuant to Section 9.05); provided that (x) the Commitment of any 

Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, 

amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any 

Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender;  

(b) no commitment fee shall accrue on the unused amount of the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender 

pursuant to Section 2.08; and  

(c) any amount payable to or for the account of any Defaulting Lender in its capacity as a Lender hereunder 

(whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise) may, in lieu of being distributed to such Defaulting 

Lender, be retained by the Administrative Agent in a segregated account and be applied, at such time or times as 

may be determined by the Administrative Agent, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender 

to the Administrative Agent hereunder.  
  

42  

 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to, 

but may in its sole discretion, ascertain or inquire as to whether any Lender shall have become, or shall have ceased 

to be, a Defaulting Lender, and shall not be required to give any notice or take any other action inconsistent with any 

determination made by it as to whether any Lender is a Defaulting Lender.  

Section 2.19. Removal or Replacement of a Lender. Anything contained herein to the contrary 

notwithstanding, in the event that: (a) (i) any Lender (an “Increased-Cost Lender”) shall give notice to the 

Borrower that such Lender is an Affected Lender or that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under Section 

2.15 or 2.16, (ii) the circumstances which have caused such Lender to be an Affected Lender or which entitle such 

Lender to receive such payments shall remain in effect and (iii) such Lender shall fail to withdraw such notice 

within five Business Days after the Borrower’s request for such withdrawal; (b) any Lender shall become a 

Defaulting Lender; or (c) in connection with any proposed waiver, amendment or other modification of any Credit 

Document, or any consent to any departure by any Credit Party therefrom, of the type referred to in Section 9.05(b), 

the consent of the Requisite Lenders shall have been obtained but the consent of one or more of such other Lenders 

(each, a “Non-Consenting Lender”) whose consent is required but shall not have been obtained; then, with respect

herewith or with any of the other Credit Documents or from the exercise of any power, discretion or authority vested 

in it hereunder or thereunder unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received instructions in respect 

thereof from the Requisite Lenders (or such other Lenders as may be required, or as the Administrative Agent shall

behalf of the Lenders or to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether 

coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or times thereafter, and the Administrative

actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) or disbursements of any 

kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any 

sub-agent thereof) or any such Related Party in exercising the powers, rights and remedies, or performing the duties,

losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the 

Administrative Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a final, non-appealable judgment

the opinion of the Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Administrative Agent may call for 

additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity 

is furnished; provided that in no event shall this sentence require any Lender to indemnify the Administrative Agent 

against any liability, obligation, loss, damage, penalty, action, judgment, suit, cost, expense or disbursement in 

excess of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share thereof; and provided further that this sentence shall not be deemed to 

require any Lender to indemnify the Administrative Agent against any liability, obligation, loss, damage,

Loans shall have been repaid in full, as of the time most recently prior thereto determined by the Administrative

Borrower and the Administrative Agent and signed by the Requisite Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall have

satisfaction of the Borrower and the Requisite Lenders, and the Administrative Agent’s resignation shall become

Administrative Agent by the Borrower and the Requisite Lenders or (c) such other date, if any, agreed to by the

has not already been appointed by the retiring Administrative Agent, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right, 

upon five Business Days’ notice to the Borrower, to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If neither the 

Requisite Lenders nor the Administrative Agent has appointed a successor Administrative Agent, the Requisite 

Lenders shall be deemed to have succeeded to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties 

of the retiring Administrative Agent. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent 

hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, that successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and

the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall promptly transfer to such successor Administrative Agent all 

records and other documents necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance of the duties of the 

successor Administrative Agent under the Credit Documents, whereupon such retiring or removed Administrative 

Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. After any retiring or removed Administrative

properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender because the appropriate form was not 

delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change 

in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective or for any other 

reason, such Lender shall indemnify the Administrative  
  

64  

 
Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise, including

States mail with postage prepaid and properly addressed; provided that no notice or other communication given to 

the Administrative Agent shall be effective until received by it; and provided further that any such notice or other 

communication shall, at the request of the Administrative Agent, be provided to any sub-agent thereof appointed 

pursuant to Section 8.03(c) from time to time. Any party hereto may change its address (including fax or telephone 

number) for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to each of the other parties hereto.  

(b) Electronic Communications.  

(i) Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by 

electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites, including the Platform) pursuant 

to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to 

any Lender pursuant to  2 if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of 

receiving notices under such  8 as the same applies to the Administrative Agent, or any other provision of any Credit 



Document as the same applies to the rights or obligations of the Administrative Agent, in each case without the 

consent of the Administrative Agent.  
  

69  

 
(d) Requisite Execution of Amendments, Etc. The Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to, 

with the concurrence of any Lender, execute waivers, amendments, modifications or consents on behalf of such 

Lender. Any waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which 

it was given. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or 

further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any waiver, amendment, modification or consent 

effected in accordance with this Section 9.05 shall be binding upon each Person that is, at the time of the 

effectiveness thereof, a Lender and each Person that subsequently becomes a Lender and, if signed by a Credit Party, 

upon such Credit Party.  

Section 9.06. Successors and Assigns; Participations. (a) Generally. This Agreement shall be binding upon 

the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and shall inure to the benefit of the 

parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby. None of the Borrower’s rights or 

obligations hereunder, nor any interest therein, may be assigned or delegated without the prior written consent of all 

the Lenders (and any attempted assignment or delegation by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and 

void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the 

parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, the participants referred to in Section 

9.06(g) (to the extent provided in clause (iii) of such Section), the Arranger and, to the extent expressly 

contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of any of the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any Lender) any legal 

or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.  

(b) Register. The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall deem and treat the Persons listed 

as Lenders in the Register as the holders and owners of the corresponding Commitments and Loans listed therein for 

all purposes hereof, and no assignment or transfer of any such Commitment or Loan shall be effective, in each case, 

unless and until recorded in the Register following receipt by the Administrative Agent of a fully executed 

Assignment Agreement effecting the assignment or transfer thereof, together with the required forms and certificates 

regarding tax matters and any fees payable in connection with such assignment, in each case, as provided in Section 

9.06(d). Each assignment shall be recorded in the Register promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent 

of the fully executed Assignment Agreement and all other necessary documents and approvals, prompt notice 

thereof shall be provided to the Borrower and a copy of such Assignment Agreement shall be maintained, as 

applicable. The date of such recordation of an assignment or transfer shall be referred to herein as the “Assignment 

Effective Date.” Any request, authority or consent of any Person that, at the time of making such request or giving 

such authority or consent, is listed in the Register as a Lender shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent 

holder, assignee or transferee of the corresponding Commitments or Loans.  

(c) Right to Assign. Each Lender shall have the right, subject to the notice and consent requirements set forth 

below in this Section 9.06(c), at any time to assign or transfer all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this 

Agreement, including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it, to:  
  

70  

 
(i) any Eligible Assignee upon the giving of notice to, and the receipt of the prior written consent of, the 

Borrower and the Administrative Agent (the consent of the Administrative Agent not to be unreasonably 

withheld); provided that the consent of the Borrower shall not be required (A) for an assignment to an Eligible 

Assignee of the type referred to in clause (a) of the definition of such term or (B) if an Event of Default shall 

have occurred and is continuing; and  

(ii) in the case of any such assignment or transfer (other than to any Person meeting the criteria of clause 

(a) of the definition of the term “Eligible Assignee”), the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the 

assigning Lender subject thereto shall not be less than $100,000,000 (or such lesser amount as may be agreed 

to by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or as shall constitute the entire remaining amount of the 

Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender); and  



(iii) each partial assignment or transfer shall be of a uniform, and not varying, percentage of all rights 

and obligations of the assigning Lender hereunder.  

(d) Mechanics. Assignments and assumptions of Loans and Commitments by Lenders shall be effected by 

manual execution and delivery to Administrative Agent of an Assignment Agreement. Assignments made pursuant 

to the foregoing provision shall be effective as of the Assignment Effective Date. In connection with all assignments 

there shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent such forms, certificates or other evidence, if any, with respect to 

United States federal income tax withholding matters as the assignee under such Assignment Agreement may be 

required to deliver pursuant to Section 2.16(c), together with payment to the Administrative Agent of a registration 

and processing fee of $3,500 (except that no such registration and processing fee shall be payable (i) in connection 

with an assignment by or to JPMCB or any Affiliate thereof or (ii) in the case of an assignee that is already a Lender 

or is an Affiliate or Related Fund of a Lender or a Person under common management with a Lender).  

(e) Representations and Warranties of Assignee. Each Lender, upon execution and delivery hereof or upon 

succeeding to an interest in the Commitments and Loans, as the case may be, represents and warrants as of the 

Closing Date or as of the Assignment Effective Date that (i) it is an Eligible Assignee, (ii) it has experience and 

expertise in the making of or investing in commitments or loans such as the applicable Commitments or Loans, as 

the case may be and (iii) it will make or invest in, as the case may be, its Commitment or Loans for its own account 

in the ordinary course and without a view to distribution of such Commitment or Loans within the meaning of the 

Securities Act or the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws (it being understood that, subject to the 

provisions of this Section 9.06, the disposition of such Commitment or Loans or any interests therein shall at all 

times remain within its exclusive control).  

(f) Effect of Assignment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 9.06, as of the “Assignment 

Effective Date” (i) the assignee thereunder shall  
  

71  

 
have the rights and obligations of a “Lender” hereunder to the extent of its interest in the Loans and Commitments 

as reflected in the Register and shall thereafter be a party hereto and a “Lender” for all purposes hereof; (ii) the 

assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to the 

assignee, relinquish its rights (other than any rights that survive the termination hereof under Section 9.08) and be 

released from its obligations hereunder (and, in the case of an assignment covering all the remaining rights and 

obligations of an assigning Lender hereunder, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto on the Assignment 

Effective Date; provided that such assigning Lender shall continue to be entitled to the benefit of all rights that 

survive the termination hereof under Section 9.08); (iii) the Commitments shall be modified to reflect any 

Commitment of such assignee, if any; and (iv) if any such assignment occurs after the issuance of any Note 

hereunder, the assigning Lender shall, upon the effectiveness of such assignment or as promptly thereafter as 

practicable, surrender its applicable Notes to the Administrative Agent for cancellation, and thereupon the Borrower 

shall issue and deliver new Notes, if so requested by the assignee and/or assigning Lender, to such assignee and/or to 

such assigning Lender, with appropriate insertions, to reflect the new Commitments or outstanding Loans of the 

assignee and/or the assigning Lender.  

(g) Participations.  

(i) Each Lender shall have the right at any time to sell one or more participations to any Person (other 

than to any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof) in all or any part of its Commitments or Loans or in any other 

Obligation.  

(ii) The holder of any such participation, other than an Affiliate of the Lender granting such 

participation, shall not be entitled to require such Lender to take or omit to take any action hereunder except 

with respect to any waiver, amendment, modification or consent that is described in Section 9.05(b) that 

affects such Participant or requires the approval of all the Lenders.  

(iii) The Borrower agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14(c), 2.15 

and 2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to 

Sections 9.06(c) and 9.06(d); provided that (A) a participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater 

payment under Section 2.15 or 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with 

respect to the participation sold to such participant, unless the sale of the participation to such participant is 



made with the Borrower’s prior written consent, and (B) a participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of 

Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such participant and such participant 

agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with and be subject to Sections 2.16, 2.17 and 2.19 as 

though it became a Lender pursuant to an Assignment Agreement; provided further that, except as specifically 

set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of this sentence, nothing herein shall require any notice to the Borrower or any 

other Person in connection with the sale of any participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at 

the Borrower’s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to  
  

72  

 
effectuate the provisions of Section 2.19 with respect to any participant. To the extent permitted by law, each 

participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.04 as though it were a Lender; provided that such 

participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.  

(iv) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the 

Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal 

amounts (and stated interest) of each participant’s interest in the Loans or other Obligations under the Credit 

Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or 

any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to 

a participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Credit 

Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such 

commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the 

United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest 

error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner 

of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the 

avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no 

responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.  

(h) Certain Other Assignments and Participations. In addition to any other assignment or participation 

permitted pursuant to this Section 9.06, any Lender may assign, pledge and/or grant a security interest in all or any 

portion of its Loans or other Obligations owed to such Lender and its Notes, if any, to secure obligations of such 

Lender, including to any Federal Reserve Bank as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of 

Governors and any operating circular issued by any Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no Lender, as between the 

Borrower and such Lender, shall be relieved of any of its obligations hereunder as a result of any such assignment 

and pledge, and provided further that in no event shall the applicable Federal Reserve Bank, pledgee or trustee be 

considered to be a “Lender” or be entitled to require the assigning Lender to take or omit to take any action 

hereunder.  

Section 9.07. Independence of Covenants. All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if 

a particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an 

exception to, or would otherwise be within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a 

Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or condition exists.  

Section 9.08. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. All covenants, agreements, 

representations and warranties made by the Credit Parties in the Credit Documents and in the certificates or other 

instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be 

considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the 

Credit Documents and the making of any Loans,  
  

73  

 
regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the 

Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of 

Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any Credit Document is executed and delivered or any 

credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued 

interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid. The 

provisions of Sections 2.14(c), 2.15, 2.16, 9.02, 9.03, 9.04 and, to the extent set forth therein, 9.17 and  8 



shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated 

hereby, the repayment of the Loans or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.  

Section 9.09. No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or 

any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall 

impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver thereof or of any Default or Event of Default or 

acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege, or any 

abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such power, right or privilege, preclude any other or further 

exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power, right or privilege. The powers, rights, privileges and remedies of 

the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Credit Documents are cumulative and shall 

be in addition to and independent of all powers, rights, privileges and remedies they would otherwise have. Without 

limiting the generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the making of any Loan 

hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the 

Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the 

time.  

Section 9.10. Marshalling; Payments Set Aside. None of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders shall be 

under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Credit Party or any other Person or against or in payment 

of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that any Credit Party makes a payment or payments to the 

Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent or any Lender enforces any security interests or 

exercises any right of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any 

part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be 

repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, any other state or federal law, common law 

or any equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be 

satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force 

and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.  

Section 9.11. Severability. In case any provision in or obligation hereunder or under any other Credit 

Document shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the 

remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way 

be affected or impaired thereby.  
  

74  

 
Section 9.12. Obligations Several; Independent Nature of Lenders’ Rights. The obligations of the Lenders 

hereunder are several, and no Lender shall be responsible for the obligations or Commitment of any other Lender 

hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in any other Credit Document, and no action taken by the Lenders pursuant 

hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Lenders as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any 

other kind of entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Lender shall be a separate and independent 

debt, and each Lender shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising hereunder and it shall not be 

necessary for any other Lender to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.  

Section 9.13. Headings.  3, this Agreement shall become effective 

when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and there shall have been delivered to the 

Administrative Agent counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties 

hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic 

imaging shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement and 

the other Credit Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and 

supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof 

(but do not supersede any other provisions of any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the 

Arranger or the Administrative Agent or other matters that do not by the terms of such documents terminate upon 

the effectiveness of this Agreement, all of which provisions shall remain in full force and effect) and JPMCB and its 

Affiliates shall be released from all liability in connection therewith, including any claim for injury or damages, 

whether consequential, special, direct, indirect, punitive or otherwise.  



Section 9.21. PATRIOT Act. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any 

Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower, on behalf of itself and each other Credit Party, that pursuant to the 

requirements of the PATRIOT  
  

79  

 
Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Credit Party, which information 

includes the name and address of each Credit Party and other information that will allow such Lender or the 

Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify such Credit Party in accordance with the PATRIOT Act.  

Section 9.22. Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words “execution”, “signed”, “signature” and words 

of like import in any Assignment Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of 

records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually 

executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as 

provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce 

Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the 

Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.  

Section 9.23. Non-Public Information. (a) In the event the Borrower shall have any Equity Interests or other 

securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or otherwise files or is required to file reports under 

Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Borrower and each Lender acknowledges that certain of the Lenders may be 

Public Lenders and, if any document, notice or other information required to be delivered hereunder is being 

distributed through the Platform, any information that the Borrower has indicated contains Non-Public Information 

will not be posted on that portion of the Platform designated for such Public Lenders. If the Borrower has not 

indicated whether a document, notice or other information provided to the Administrative Agent by or on behalf of 

the Borrower or any Subsidiary contains Non-Public Information, the Administrative Agent reserves the right to 

post such information solely on the portion of the Platform designated for Lenders that wish to receive material 

Non-Public Information with respect to the Borrower, the Subsidiaries and its and their securities. Notwithstanding 

the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9.23 shall create any obligation on the Borrower to indicate whether any 

information contains Non-Public Information, it being further agreed that if any such indication is provided by the 

Borrower in its discretion, such indication shall create no obligation on the Borrower to provide any such indication 

in the future.  

(b) Each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public Lender to at all 

times have selected the “Private Side Information” or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the 

Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lender’s compliance 

procedures and applicable law, including United State federal and state securities laws, to make reference to 

information that is not made available through the “Public Side Information” portion of the Platform and that may 

contain Non Public Information with respect to the Borrower, the Subsidiaries or its or their securities.  

Section 9.24. No Fiduciary Duty. The Administrative Agent, each Lender and their Affiliates (collectively, 

solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Lenders”) may have economic interests that conflict with those of the 

Borrower. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that nothing in the Credit Documents or otherwise will be 

deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other  
  

80  

 
implied duty between the Lenders and the Borrower, its Affiliates or its stockholders. The Borrower further 

acknowledges and agrees that (a) the transactions contemplated by the Credit Documents (including the exercise of 

rights and remedies thereunder) are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, 

and the Credit Parties, on the other, (b) in connection therewith and with the process leading thereto, (i) no Lender 

has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of any Credit Party, its Affiliates or its stockholders 

with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or 

the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise any 

Credit Party, its Affiliates or its stockholders on other matters) or any other obligation to any Credit Party except the 

obligations expressly set forth in the Credit Documents and (ii) each Lender is acting solely as a principal and not as 

the agent or fiduciary of any Credit Party, its Affiliates, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person. 



The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it 

deemed appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to such 

transactions and the process leading thereto. The Borrower agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered 

advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Credit Parties, in connection 

with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

For an agreed consideration, the Assignor hereby irrevocably sells and assigns to the Assignee, and the

Assignor’s rights and obligations in respect of the Commitments and Loans under the Credit Agreement and any 

other documents or instruments delivered pursuant thereto that represents the amount and percentage interest 

identified below of all of the Assignor’s outstanding rights and obligations in respect thereof under the Credit

THE GUARANTEES  

Section 2.01. Guarantee. Each Subsidiary Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each of 

the Guaranteed Parties, jointly with the other Subsidiary Guarantors and severally, as a primary obligor and not 

merely as a surety, by way of an independent payment obligation, the due and punctual payment and performance of 

the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed Obligations may be 

extended or renewed, in whole or in part, or amended or modified, without notice to or further assent from it, and 

that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any extension, renewal, amendment or 

modification of any Guaranteed Obligation. Each Subsidiary Guarantor waives presentment to, demand of payment 

from and protest to the Borrower or any other Credit Party of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and also waives 

notice of acceptance of its guarantee hereunder and notice of protest for nonpayment.  

Section 2.02. Guarantee of Payment; Continuing Guarantee. Each Subsidiary Guarantor further agrees that its 

guarantee hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar 

proceeding shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or operated as a 

discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the 

Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party to any security held for the payment of any of the Guaranteed 

Obligations or to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any other 

Guaranteed Party in favor of the Borrower, any other Credit Party or any other Person. Each Subsidiary Guarantor 

agrees that its guarantee hereunder is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether 

currently existing or hereafter incurred.  
  

2  

 
Section 2.03. No Limitations. (a) Except for the termination or release of a Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligations 

hereunder as expressly provided in Sections 5.16(a) and 5.16(b), the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor 

hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including any 

claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, 

counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality, unenforceability or 

impossibility in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the 

foregoing, except for the termination or release of its obligations hereunder as expressly provided in Sections 5.16(a) 



and 5.16(b), the obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or 

otherwise affected by:  

(i) the failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party to assert any claim or demand 

or to enforce any right or remedy under the provisions of any Credit Document or otherwise,  

(ii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or other modification of, or any release from any of the terms or 

provisions of, any Credit Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any other Subsidiary 

Guarantor under this Agreement,  

(iii) the release of any security held by the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party for any 

of the Guaranteed Obligations,  

(iv) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, 

or  

(v) any other act or omission that may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any 

Subsidiary Guarantor or otherwise operate as a discharge of any Subsidiary Guarantor as a matter of law or 

equity.  

Each Subsidiary Guarantor expressly authorizes the Guaranteed Parties to take and hold security for the payment 

and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, to exchange, waive or release any or all such security (with or 

without consideration), to enforce or apply such security and direct the order and manner of any sale thereof in their 

sole discretion or to release or substitute any one or more other guarantors or obligors upon or in respect of the 

Guaranteed Obligations, all without affecting the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder.  

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Subsidiary Guarantor waives any defense based on 

or arising out of any defense of the Borrower or any other Credit Party or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed 

Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of  
  

3  

 
the liability of the Borrower or any other Credit Party, other than the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the 

Guaranteed Obligations. The Administrative Agent and the other Guaranteed Parties may, at their election, foreclose 

on any security held by one or more of them by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of 

any such security in lieu of foreclosure, compromise or adjust any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, make any 

other accommodation with the Borrower or any other Credit Party or exercise any other right or remedy available to 

them against the Borrower or any other Credit Party, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any 

Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full 

in cash. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Subsidiary Guarantor waives any defense arising out 

of any such election even though such election operates, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or to extinguish any 

right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such Subsidiary Guarantor against the Borrower 

or any other Credit Party, as the case may be, or any security.  

Section 2.04. Reinstatement. Each Subsidiary Guarantor agrees that its guarantee hereunder shall continue to 

be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Guaranteed 

Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Guaranteed Party upon the bankruptcy or 

reorganization of the Borrower or any other Credit Party or otherwise.  

Section 2.05. Agreement to Pay; Subrogation. In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any 

other right that the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party has at law or in equity against any 

Subsidiary Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Borrower or any other Credit Party to pay any 

Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of 

prepayment or otherwise, each Subsidiary Guarantor hereby promises to and will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, 

to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the applicable Guaranteed Parties in cash the amount of such unpaid 

Guaranteed Obligation. Upon payment by any Subsidiary Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent as 

provided above, all rights of such Subsidiary Guarantor against the Borrower or any other Credit Party arising as a 

result thereof by way of right of subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall in all 

respects be subject to  3.  



Section 2.06. Information. Each Subsidiary Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself 

informed of the Borrower’s and each other Credit Party’s financial condition and assets, and of all other 

circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent 

of the risks assumed or incurred by such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder, and agrees that none of the Guaranteed 

Parties will have any duty to advise such Subsidiary Guarantor of any information known to any Guaranteed Party 

regarding such circumstances or risks.

INDEMNITY, SUBROGATION AND SUBORDINATION  

Section 3.01. Indemnity and Subrogation. In addition to all rights of indemnity and subrogation the Subsidiary 

Guarantors may have under applicable law (but subject to Section 3.03) in respect of any payment hereunder, the 

Borrower agrees that in the event a payment of any obligation of the Borrower shall be made by any Subsidiary 

Guarantor under this Agreement, the Borrower shall indemnify such Subsidiary Guarantor for the full amount of 

such payment and such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Person to whom such payment 

shall have been made to the extent of such payment.  

Section 3.02. Contribution and Subrogation. Each Subsidiary Guarantor (a “Contributing Party”) agrees 

(subject to Section 3.03) that, in the event a payment shall be made by any other Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder in 

respect of any Guaranteed Obligation and such other Subsidiary Guarantor (the “Claiming Party”) shall not have 

been fully indemnified by the Borrower as provided in Section 3.01, the Contributing Party shall indemnify the 

Claiming Party in an amount equal to the amount of such payment, multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator 

shall be the net worth of the Contributing Party on the date hereof and the denominator shall be the sum of the 

respective net worth of all the Subsidiary Guarantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Subsidiary Guarantor 

becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 5.17, the date of the Supplement pursuant to which such Subsidiary 

Guarantor became a party hereto). Any Contributing Party making any payment to any Claiming Party pursuant to 

this Section 3.02 shall (subject to Section 3.03) be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Party under 

Section 3.01 to the extent of such payment.  

Section 3.03. Subordination. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the 

Subsidiary Guarantors under Sections 3.01 and 3.02 and all other rights of the Subsidiary Guarantors of indemnity, 

contribution or subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible 

payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. No failure on the part of the Borrower or any Subsidiary 

Guarantor to make the payments required by Sections 3.01 and 3.02 (or any other payments required under 

applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and liabilities of any Subsidiary Guarantor 

with respect to its obligations hereunder, and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall remain liable for the full amount of 

the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor hereunder.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  

Each Subsidiary Guarantor represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and the other Guaranteed 

Parties that (a) the execution, delivery and  
  

5  

 
performance by such Subsidiary Guarantor of this Agreement are within such Subsidiary Guarantor’s corporate or 

other organizational powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other organizational and, if 

required, stockholder or other equityholder action, and that this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by 

such Subsidiary Guarantor and is the legally valid and binding obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor, enforceable 

against such Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by 

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or limiting creditors’ rights generally 

or by equitable principles relating to enforceability, and (b) all representations and warranties as to such Subsidiary 

Guarantor set forth in each Credit Document are true and correct in all material respects (except insofar as such 



inaccuracy thereof would not be material and adverse to the creditworthiness of the Borrower or constitute a 

material breach of any Credit Document from the point of view of a Person extending credit to the Borrower as 

contemplated by the Credit Documents) on and as of the date hereof to the same extent as though made on and as of 

the date hereof, except in the case of any such representation and warranty that expressly relates to a prior date, in 

which case such representation and warranty was true and correct in all material respects (except insofar as such 

inaccuracy thereof would not be material and adverse to the creditworthiness of the Borrower or constitute a 

material breach of any Credit Document from the point of view of a Person extending credit to the Borrower as 

contemplated by the Credit Documents) on and as of such prior date; provided that, in each case, such materiality 

qualifier is not applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality 

in the text thereof.

connection with, as a result of or in any way related to this Agreement or any other Credit Document or any 

agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby or referred to herein or therein, the transactions

Section 5.04. Set-Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way 

of limitation of any such rights, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing, each Lender is hereby 

authorized by each Subsidiary Guarantor at any time or from time to time, without notice to such Subsidiary 

Guarantor or any other Person (other than the Administrative Agent), but subject to the approval of the Requisite 

Lenders, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all 

deposits (general or special, time or demand, provision or final, in whatever currency, including Indebtedness 

evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but excluding trust accounts) or other amounts 

at any time held or owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of such Subsidiary Guarantor against 

and on account of the obligations then due of such Subsidiary Guarantor to such Lender hereunder and under the 

other Credit Documents, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder.

amended or modified, and no consent to any departure by any Credit Party therefrom may be made, except pursuant

other terms of Section 9.05 of the Credit Agreement.  



Section 5.06. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their 

respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their 

respective successors and assigns permitted hereby. No rights or obligations hereunder of any Subsidiary Guarantor,

Agreement.  

Section 5.07. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. All covenants, agreements, 

representations and warranties made by any Credit  
  

7  

 
Party hereunder or in any other Credit Document, or in any certificate or instrument delivered in connection with or 

pursuant to any Credit Document, shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Guaranteed Parties and shall 

survive the execution and delivery hereof and of the other Credit Documents and the making of the Loans, 

regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Guaranteed Party and notwithstanding that any 

Guaranteed Party may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation 

or warranty at the time of the making of any Loan, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any 

Commitment is in effect or the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan, any commitment fee or any other 

amount payable under any Credit Document is outstanding and unpaid. The provisions of Sections 5.02, 5.03, 5.04 

and 5.19 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions 

contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.  

Section 5.08. No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent, 

the Arranger or any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit 

Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver thereof or of any Default or 

Event of Default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or 

privilege, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such power, right or privilege, preclude any 

other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power, right or privilege. The powers, rights, privileges 

and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Arranger and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Credit 

Documents are cumulative and shall be in addition to and independent of all powers, rights, privileges and remedies 

they would otherwise have. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the execution and delivery of this 

Agreement or the making of any Loan hereunder shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of 

Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any Lender may have had notice or 

knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time.
